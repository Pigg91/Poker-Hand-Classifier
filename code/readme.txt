1. Install packages in R : caret,randomForest, e1071, gbm, class, tree


2. When running the R file, make sure you set your working directory to where the file is.

   This can be done by:
setwd("PATH to where the R file is located")


3. source before.R (this is before processing dataset)

4. source processing.R (this is to gain a new dataset)
